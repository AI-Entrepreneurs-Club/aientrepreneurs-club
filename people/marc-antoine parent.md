# Marc-Antoine Parent

## About

* I'm an Information architect and developer (focused on Python, Postgres, and the semantic web), based in Montreal
* I am developing many projects, but the core underlying focus is the represention of diversity of viewpoints and opinions. The underlying architecture for this is under development as [[HyperKnowledge]].
* Since it's work in progress, I am also doing many projects (below) that do not yet use HyperKnowledge fully, but are often evolving towards it.

## My projects

* [[HyperKnowledge]] is an evolving architecture for representation of federated structured knowledge.
* [[ClaimMiner]] started as a RAG project for [Society Library](https://societylibrary.org), and I'm refactoring it to become a modular substrate for unstructured knowledge based projects. Code base to be re-opened soon.
* [[SenseCraft]] is a structured conversation team game, developed with [TopicQuests](http://topicquests.org) based on the ideas of [[jack park]].
* [IdeaLoom](https://idealoom.org) is an earlier effort to have a platform to extract structured ideas from mailing list conversations, developed with Imagination for People and then (after a merger) for Bluenove.
* [Memebrane](https://github.com/openglobalmind/memebrane) is a cache layer to (early) APIs of [TheBrain](https://www.thebrain.com), developed for the [[free jerrys brain]] section of [Open Global Mind](https://openglobalmind.com)
