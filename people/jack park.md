## About
I started out to be an aero engineer, which enabled me to design wind power systems (gliders with a bearing), which caused me to explore microprocessor-based weather stations for finding appropriate (windy) sites. Interestingly, farmers got interested in my weather station data for predictions about fruit frost, pest control, and irrigation, which led to an interest in artificial intelligence to analyze data.  Which led to a 5-year engagement at SRI International on a very large AI personal assistant project (CALO). Which led to an invitation to work on a PhD  project to apply aspects of artificial intelligence to the process of *taming wicked conversations*

## My projects
* [[OpenSherlock]] is an evolving knowledge modeling and discovery platform which reads documents and creates and maintains high-level structures like topic maps (akn to *knowledge graphs*), and conceptual graphs.  In the long run, OpenSherlock will become a part of [[marc-antoine parent]]'s [[HyperKnowledge]] ecosystem
* [[SenseCraft]] is a joint effort with [[marc-antoine parent]] and represents another approach to *taming wicked conversations*
