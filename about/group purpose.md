# What is this group for, and what would an AI group directory look like?

*2023-11-19: This page currently just has the opinion of [[mathew lowry]], but feel free to add your own thoughts in your own section, or just upload a separate file.*

At [[meeting 2023-11-16]] we discussed, inter alia, these 2 interrelated points:

* what the Ai entrepreneurs group should be for
* what the entire "AI group space" needs

## Mathew's take

### This group 

This is just my opinion on the first point: let's **start as a small, focused that *does***: identify one or a few projects with enough in common that they would benefit from some common, shared actions. 

Hence [[projects]], which will need to be chosen carefully to ensure synergies. We'll need a mix of people so the group becomes a place where tech expertise meets business ideas/needs. Hence [[people]].

While the focus will be on the projects to begin with at least, a lot of the other benefits many of us want to see - peer2peer support & learning, advice & feedback, network building, etc - should emerge as a result. 

This will probably keep the group small for a while, but if there are positive results then other projects can be added if they meet the similarity test. 
### Cross-pollination between groups

If this group develops a clear idea of what it *is*, it will be also clear what it *isn't*. If each group set up for discussing AI had such a clear - and clearly expressed - mission, people would find it easier to have the right conversation in the right place. 

But cross-pollination between groups would still be essential - possibly more so. How?
#### AI group directory

Some form of group directory would be a start: help people find the places best suited to their needs. How might that look?  

Ideally the directory would be some form of airtable, but before we can define those columns we need to have a good sample of raw content, for which a wiki like this is extremely useful. Hence my first suggestions for how [[projects]] and [[people]] can be described.

#### Other ideas

Each group will, of course, organise itself as they see fit, using whatever tools they choose. But I can't help wondering whether it would be possible to use AI to help organise this space to help people find the right *individual conversations*. 

One off the cuff idea from our meeting was that participating groups (some sort of voluntary federation model?) would use AI to summarise transcripts of their meetings, which could be dumped in some shared repository where they can be searched and browsed.
