SenseCraft tries to transform structured conversations into a team game. Currently, the structure is essentially IBIS, as desribed in Jeff Conklin's [Dialogue Mapping](https://www.amazon.com/Dialogue-Mapping-Building-Understanding-Problems/dp/0470017686) book. The aim is to enable collective intelligence quests, but also to teach people better conversation skills.

## Current status

* People can form guilds (teams) and register to quests (games).
* In a quest, they are presented with an initial question, the root of an IBIS conversation tree
* They can propose nodes to enrich the tree. Internal guild dynamics will allow to decide which of those proposed nodes are published.
* When a node is published, it becomes visible to all guilds which can improve on it.
* We have a simple scoring mechanism to determine which nodes contributed to answer the question.

## Next steps

Our naive approach to scoring is too limited, and it's too easy to play strategically without really enriching the conversation. The next iteration of SenseCraft should encourage deep listening, by encouraging players to identify cognitive patterns in the proposed contributions of other guilds, and to rate other guild's contributions in terms of how much insight they brought to the conversation. The pattern catalogue should be enriched by players themselves, and mastery of the patterns should become part of the player's profile. The work on dynamic schamas in [[HyperKnowledge]] and [[SenseCraft]] should become relevant.
