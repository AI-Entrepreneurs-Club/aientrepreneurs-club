## Today at a glance

* A Hub provides each Hub Editor with a central place on the web which combines:
	- **social bookmarks** (think pinboard), or *Stuff I Like*: content you curate for yourself and your audience with a bookmarklet - the sort of "recommended reading" you'd share with your followers, but with your notes attached, written as you Hub it 
	- **blog:** *Stuff I Think* are the Editor's blog posts, whether they're published on the Hub or published elsewhere (Medium, LinkedIn) and curated onto the Hub
	* **personal portfolio**: *"What I Do"*, published on the Hub or curated onto it.
	* more: [What is MyHub.ai, What is a Hub, and Who’s it for?](https://myhub.ai/items/faq-what-is-myhubai-what-is-a-hub-and-whos-it-for) 
* all of these resources are tagged *and* there's faceted search, so it's easy to create a Collection of "[All the Stuff I Like or Think (but not Do) tagged AI and creativity this year](https://myhub.ai/@mathewlowry/?quality=all&types=like&types=think&tags=creativity&tags=ai&timeframe=this_year)", for example
* current integration with ChatGPT allows an Editor to **send a collection of resources to ChatGPT and have a conversation with it about them**. 
	* I showed this briefly at our first meeting - it's demo'd in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PykfgbRwZiY) (0 - 1m40)
	* this feature will soon be offered to early adopters to play with for free for a limited time. See announcement in this [newsletter edition](https://myhub.ai/items/myhub-chatgpt-integration-newsletter-october-2023)
* I'm running an experimental programme in public as I try and find the most useful prompts and GPTs within this context: see [About experiments.myhub.ai](https://experiments.myhub.ai/about/about_this_massive_wiki)).

## Tomorrow at a glance

* **this month**: as showed briefly at our first meeting I have some features already designed to help Editors better use ChatGPT to extract more value from their Hubbed resources: Editors will develop manage a prompt library within their Hub, saving the resulting conversations if they wish - see the same video [from 1m39](https://youtu.be/PykfgbRwZiY?si=XmV1wbKAE2YTuG_O&t=99)
* **long-term**: I want MyHub to support the evolution of a wider **open source collective intelligence ecosystem**, as set out in [A Minimum Viable Ecosystem for collective intelligence](https://mathewlowry.medium.com/a-minimum-viable-ecosystem-for-collective-intelligence-7738848ce9c4) last January. TL:DR::
	* extend MyHub's back-office so it supports Editors' entire personal content pipeline, turning the MyHub back-office into a better Tool4Thought (TfT) and/or creating plugins for existing TfTs - see [Thinking and writing in a decentralised collective intelligence ecosystem](https://mathewlowry.medium.com/thinking-and-writing-in-a-decentralised-collective-intelligence-ecosystem-16dd2b1893cc)
	* hooking these thinking systems together via open standards - see [Social knowledge graphs for collective intelligence ](https://mathewlowry.medium.com/social-knowledge-graphs-for-collective-intelligence-75c436889320)
	* better integrating AIs into both back- and front-office so that Editors **and their visitors** can benefit fully from LLMs, in the process *training* the LLMs, which are then monetised to further finance ecosystem development - [How Artificial Intelligence will finance Collective Intelligence](https://mathewlowry.medium.com/how-artificial-intelligence-will-finance-collective-intelligence-5d17adcce98b)
		* note: this is the part which probably needs most revision: this business models may not work, but others are possible
* between "this month" and long-term - see below.

## Where I'd like help

I need 

* **feedback and advice** to help me chart a course from *this month* to the *long term vision* (both described above). My current plan is as follows:
	1. later this month early adopters will be able to play with the relatively primitive ChatGPT integration currently available free of charge
	2. that should help me see if there's any interest in a "premium Hub" product, and (if so) what it would look like (some ideas below)
	3. roll out the "premium Hub" product (this may require some investment)
	4. if people start paying for a premium hub, that should provide me with a basis for raising further investment
* ideally, some **help raising investment** if/when I get to points 3 and/or 4

## Envisioning a premium hub

A "premium Hub" product could offer much more than any blog or Substack, as a Hub could be **monetised by the Editor**, who would be able to offer Hub subscribers:

- the Editor's blog and newsletter (ie, like Substack) 
- _plus_ the resources the author has read and recommends _and_ his/her notes about them, all easily searchable and filterable (unlike Substack)
- PLUS an array of chatbots visible to Subscribers, each 
	- focused on helping each Subscriber get the most out of the Hub's resources
	- writing in the voice of the Hub Editor 

The Editor, moreover, has all of the above _plus_:

* a set of reading, thinking and writing tools arrayed in a content creation pipeline
* all integrated together in a wider, open-source, decentralised collective intelligence ecosystem 
* with each stage supported by dedicated chatbots
