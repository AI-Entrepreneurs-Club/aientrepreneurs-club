# AI Entrepreneurs Club

We are a group of friends and colleagues who share a passion for both entrepreneurship and AI. We meet and chat on a Discord server.

The Club is a place to get support (business and emotional!), swap haves/needs, share AI news, get candid feedback about business ideas and pitches, etc. 

This website is a combination of front door/calling card, and a bit of a knowledgebase.

If you're interested in participating, email [Peter Kaminski](mailto:kaminski@istori.com?subject=AIEntrepreneursClub).
