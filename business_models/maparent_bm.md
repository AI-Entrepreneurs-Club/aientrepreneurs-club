Here is a quick overview of what I ([[marc-antoine parent]]) think the business opportunities are, who are the clients and their needs.

1. Synthesis at scale: Co-create a synthetic overview from multiple viewpoints of a large number of stakeholders.
    1. Anybody talking on behalf of many people: Umbrella organizations like United Way, Unions, Professional organizations, Political parties, inclusive political governance...
    2. A concept map is easier to assemble from many parts than a synthesis text.
        1. Harder to contribute to a concept map in a way that is understandable by others
        2. A synthesis text may be easier to consume than a map: Translation is a good LLM opportunity
    3. Clients:
        1. Synthesis curator:
            1. Is the synthesis manageable and intelligible?
        2. Contributor:
            1. Is my viewpoint well represented?
        3. Decider (if distinct): Do I have all the information I need?
            1. Note that decider's interest may not be aligned with their constituency, hence they may not want an accurate synthesis
2. Collective external memory: A concept graph can store collective memory greater than any single person can absorb, let alone remember.
    1. Subcase: Collective access to individual memory.
    2. Important feature: Contested knowledge and its epistemic justification
    3. Clients:
        1. Learner:
            1. Did I understand/learn everything I need to learn about a given topic? (Goal of exhaustivity)
            2. Can I understand everything on this map? (Enrich cognitive toolbox)
            3. Can I get what I need just-in-time?
        2. Contributor:
            1. Is my viewpoint well explained to others? (Goal of propagation)
            2. Is there any new conclusion to be drawn from the current map content? (Enrich knowledge)
            3. Can I contest/reinterpret soemone else's viewpoint? Can we resolve this?
3. Collective collaboration
    1. Match capabilities with needs; match mutual expectations
        1. Close to ValueFlo.ws use case
    2. Reflect on mismatched expectation, second-loop learning
        1. Cf collective external memory above; added dimension of combining both needs
    3. Clients:
        1. Solution provider and consumer (janus role)
            1. Express offer (expected impact) in a way that facilitates matching
            2. Express inputs (needs) in a way that facilitates matching
            3. Reflect on mismatch between expected and actual impact (collective learning)
