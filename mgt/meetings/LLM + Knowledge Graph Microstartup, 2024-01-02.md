# LLM + Knowledge Graph Microstartup, 2024-01-02

## Topics

- active inference / free energy
    - bayesian = probability
    - current LLMs are ossified at time of training
    - when will we kill off RAG?
- Brainstorming for Biz Plan for LLMs + Knowledge Graph microstartup

### Phases

- prototyping
- mvp
- market validation

## Prompting Questions

what's the problem or deep need?

if we can't articulate how i'm solving a problem for the audience...

how are they solving this need / problem already? (if they are)

this serves as a "north star" we can come back to

going down a particular technology path means you're probably distracting yourself from the questions above

as a customer, what do i get from using this product? (personal good, social good)

(distinguish user vs. payer, add value streams)

### Needs

- wrt The Climate Web, people need to access climate information more easily via a conversational interface
    - e.g., teachers trying to come up with curriculums for their 8th grade class
    - no one trying to "solve climate change", they have a particular need

- wrt Jerry's Brain, perhaps someone wants to have a "conversation" with Jerry by proxy?

- what does adding an LLM to a knowledge graph do? help people bridge the gap between what they know and what they don't know. iteratively.

- an automated, updater / teacher

- clone expertise, update the info, be an automated tutor

- LLM Hard problem: diagnosing faulty reasoning during a chat session

- as a group, people who want to be heard as a group

- as a content asset owner, i want to increase the ability for people find and bind to my information resource

- as a content owner, i want to be able to generate short-form content (tweets, blog posts) to help people develop more interest in my knowledgebase

- can the kb ask questions of the user?

- use the LLM for outbound outreach - reply to questions on mastodon, twitter, reddit, as a way to attract people to the kb

- participative knowledge construction

- map view - here are other things that you should know about; use (some technology) to help people find out what they don't know
    - give them this information after giving them a good answer to a question they already have

- People should be able to ask our tools: “What are my blind spots?”

- Here's what you can do to work on climate change.

- let me help you start to navigate an interesting information space, that has a somewhat difficult interface. i'll write instructions and steps that make it easy.

## Observations

- using ChatGPT (after hearing about it virally) helps people be more clear in asking questions

## Personal Wellness

## Knowing Hubs

- game-based
- deep knowledgebase

## Marketing Approaches

- you don't know as much as you should (maybe true, but not very nice)
- we can help you have more knowledge

## Prompting Questions

- who is the customer? (who pays)
    - consumer
    - expert
    - content owner
    - manager of user (school administrator, teacher)

## Value Proposition Statements
For (target customer)
Who (statement of unmet customer need)
The (product/service) is a (recognized product category)
That (statement of key benefit).
Unlike (primary competitive alternative),
Our product (statement of primary differentiation).

- “A tornado just knocked over my mobilehome. Who should I blame?”
- Zeus?
- Thor?
- game?

- one of my many attempts to explain myself: https://www.strategylidar.com/
- climate mitigation questions are soon to become prevelant
- i think they'll often not be expressed as climate mitigation questions
- Is Mark the customer or are ClimateWeb users the customers?
- Seems to me that Mark’s “need” is to satisfy some subset of society’s “needs”
- broader thinking?
- better decisions
