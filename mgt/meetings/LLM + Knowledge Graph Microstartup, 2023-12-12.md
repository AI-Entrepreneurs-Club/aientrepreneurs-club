# LLM + Knowledge Graph Microstartup, 2023-12-12

## Homework

- use <https://aientrepreneurs.club> as our wiki
    - create a folder or some other organization
- develop use cases
- do market research with our use cases

## Discussion

- Pete's "micro-pitch"
- consult Harlan about this project?
- crowdsource funding from TheBrain users?
- what's really possible with the tech we're proposing
- could the system write ebooks? write ebooks faster and better?
- are there technical limitations based on API access? probably not
- graph embeddings along with text embeddings
- questions:
    - what can we ask of this brain?
    - what's missing in this brain that can be found in the LLM and in the web?
    - can we have kind of “cognitive companion” -a place to have a truly deep conversation? (But,conversations are far more than question answering.)
- Marc-Antoine would want the core infrastructure to be open source
- graph view are shiny objects, but not as useful as e.g. page views
    - could an LLM turn the brain into a collection of narrative structures (page views)
- ... avatars for influencers that make available, harness, their knowledge graph, their other sources  and develop a chat bot for their digital footprint and not just a brain. Let's call it a "supply of wisdom" model
    - for a consumer, can i do this for myself? can i review all my own digital footprints?
- the idea of how to shepherd learning conversations that push the learning edges
    - who would be willing to to pay to be in these kind of learning edge conversations that were accelerated in some way shape or form.
- different systems, not just TheBrain
    - DebateGraph, Kumu, Notion, Logseq, Obsidian, etc....
- guided online learning
- LLM-assisted / shepherding / discerning whether/how to venture forward
- what could this group do that won't get done some other way?
    - emphasis on higher-level cognitive structures
    - compositional thought
    - commitments to having some parts of it being open source
    - being a generic core platform with plugin adaptors (cassettes) which enable the core to interface with different sources
    - building a tool for exploring TheBrains



## Pete's Simple Business Plan Template

### Overview

- give a summary paragraph or two of your business.  what does it do? why will it matter?
