# AI Entrepreneurship, 2023-11-16
 
 - a growing of "AI" communities of practice, discussion circles
     - "when too many "AI communities of practice, discussion circles" are barely enough
- GPTs
    - OpenAI
    - any hints on the Store's revshare?
    - 
- future of AI Entrepreneurship
- AI + graph knowledgebases
- any feedback on my (ML) post-meeting updates?
- open-source ecosystem in the LLM arena
    - multi-LLMs

## AI Groups

- opportunity for federated learning
- want to be able to cross-pollinate but also specialize
- groups should have an agenda / or notes
- shared knowledge map
- comparisons: Plex, TfT Map
- groups who like to do things vs. groups who like to learn things
- groups who are meeting on a topic (a learning community), vs. groups who are doing a project vs. a group of people each doing projects
    - field-directed
    - goal-directed
- Issue of group announcing conversations before or after the fact
    - off the cuff idea: use AI to find conversations across groups
        - each group uses AI to summarise transcripts of their meeting 
        - published/shared centrally (federated?) and further indexed/processed by AI
- curation
    - multiple perspectives on what the group is about
        - the group may not have a clear agenda itself
- 
- what does "AI" mean?

    - chatbots
    - image generators
    - other ways that neural networks get used
        - machine translation
        - autocategorisation
    - traditional symbolic AI
        - Symbolic reasoning
        - Rule-based
        - NLP
    - Numerical machine learning

- Marketplace for AI-generated products (art etc.)
    - What is the market value of AI?

- NFTs as a way to sell AI
- ValueFlo.ws for Gen Art inspiration using similarity

Getting involved as individuals vs. as teams

## Groups

- Quorum One
- AI Salon
- Active Inference

## Fields

- hybrid computing

## What Should _This_ Group Specialize In?

- patterns of problems + patterns of solutions
    - e.g. RAG - how can we use it? what is it good for?
- sharing business cases, use cases
    - where tech push v business case experts meet -> share efforts & resources
- project idea: organizing information by nature categorizations (e.g. watersheds)
- project idea: build LLM interfaces to Jerry's Brain, The Climate Web, etc.
- peer-to-peer support for AI entrepreneurs
    - marketing
    - business case validation
    - emotional support
    - technology advice (-> shared efforts)
- sound like we need 
    - self-describe who we are, what we're looking for
    - describe the groups we're in
    - define on the group's USP
- focus on ONE project, or create a space to support ALL members' projects, or create a space supporting a *strictly defined* set of related projects?
    - poll?
    - wiki?

Need to join a group

- synergy with my project(s)
- coherence with my field(s)
- Bring-my-issue salon

Challenges to cross-pollination

- communication (at all)
- discovery
- scheduling
- creating mix(es) of casual conversation, topic-based conversation, project-based work
    - project lifecycle

Database: cross-group directory (tecnorati for AI groups?)

- projects
- people
- groups
- Project infrastructure/common elements/patterns/ideas/wishes

- idea: start with the mattermost groups and people, and then build out?
- this is what i'm working on
- this is what i need help with
- this the class of problems i'm looking for answers for

---

How do we level up the discussion around a topic (say, climate change) based on having a large corpus and LLM technology? People keep having the same 101 conversations about the wrong topics....

How do we figure out the specialist vocabularies? How do we map different vocabularies to each other?

Next steps:

- converse (even some babbling!) in Mattermost
- we'll work on an Airtable
- Pete will share how to edit the https://aientrepreneurs.club/ wiki
- next meeting, November 30, 15 minutes later
